This is the roadmap document for the *urbangarden* project. It describes the
remaining work to do until version *1.0*.

## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward
compatibility, all project components are maintained under
[the Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/).
